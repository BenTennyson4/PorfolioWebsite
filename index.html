            <p class="bioDescription">
                I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with 
                a bachelors degree in Computer Science. At UTD I gained a foundational
                knowledge of programming, data structures, and algorithms. The programming
                languages I am most proficient in include Java and Python, however, I am also familiar 
                languages such as C, C++, and C#. I also gained experience with AI, ML, 
                and data analytics through electives and projects. I worked with within teams 
                on various projects, which gave me strong collaboration and problem-solving skills, 
                helping me to work effectivley in teams. 
            </p>
            <p class="bioDescription">
                I am currently looking for a job where I can contribute as a hard-working 
                software developer or software engineer, and continue to grow professionally 
                and gain new skills.

                Cross-database Analysis Web App:
            </a>
            This app was developed to perform user auditing, specifically for a 
            hospitals EMR and their HR data to reconcile active users from users who 
            need to be terminated/disabled in the system. This tool was designed to 
            match exactly on identified fields and when these matches were not found, 
            it performed 'like' matching to reduce the time needed by business 
            analysts to manually match the data. It is a full-stack web app with a 
            clean, easy-to-use UI, and the app enables users to upload data from multiple 
            systems to a MySQL database. After data has been uploaded, the user can 
            perform searches using the search bar, or they can generate exportable reports.

                Java Math Server:
            </a> 
            Developed with a fellow student at UTD for a networking class project.
            Math Server is a multi-threaded TCP server implemented in Java that processes simple infix 
            math expressions sent by clients. The server supports multiple simultaneous client connections 
            evaluates expressions, and returns the results in first-come first-served (FCFS) order. 
            Clients can gracefully terminate the session using the CLOSE command.

                Real Estate Valuation Analysis:
            </a>
            Designed and implemented a ML pipeline to predict real estate valuations using SGDRegressor, 
            including data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation with metrics 
            such as MSE, R², and explained variance. Automated logging of experimental results, visualized 
            predictions and residuals, and created baseline comparisons for model assessment.

                To Do List Web App:
            </a>
            Designed and developed a full-stack task management web application using C#, ASP.NET 
            Core Web API, and SQL Server. Built and consumed RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, 
            user notifications, and calendar-linked task retrieval, while designing relational
            database schemas with stored procedures. Created responsive UIs in HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript and produced technical documentation (SRS, use cases, EER models, sequence 
            diagrams) to support understanding and future development.
